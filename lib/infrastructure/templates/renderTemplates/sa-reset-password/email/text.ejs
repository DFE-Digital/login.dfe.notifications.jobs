Dear <%=firstName%> <%=lastName%>

We've received a request for your DfE Sign-in password to be reset, but you haven’t yet created a DfE Sign-in account.

We’re sending you this email because we recognise your address as a Secure Access user.

You need to set up a DFE Sign in account. So we know who you are, we will ask for your Secure Access username and password as part of the account set-up process, but after that you’ll only need to use your email address and password.

To set up your DfE Sign in account, please follow the link below:

Thank you

DfE Sign-in

If you did not make this request, please delete this email.
