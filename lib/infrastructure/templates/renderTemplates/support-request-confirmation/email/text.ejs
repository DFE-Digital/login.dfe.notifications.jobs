Dear <%=name%>

Thank you for contacting the DFE Sign-in service desk.

Your service request has been received and will be addressed shortly. In the meantime, you may find the guidance below useful:

What is DfE Sign-in and where has Secure Access gone?

DfE Sign-in is the new way to access your services.
If you previously used Secure Access to access your services, you will need to <%=saUrl%> migrate your account to DfE Sign-in.
If you have a DfE Sign-in account, you will need to enter your email and DfE Sign-in password.

I haven’t migrated my Secure Access account to DfE Sign-in yet:

Go to <%=saUrl%> migrate your account and follow instructions. You only need to complete the migration journey the first time you visit DfE Sign-in.
Any subsequent visits will only require you to enter your username (email address) and password once.

Already have a DfE Sign-in account?

Once you have successfully migrated your account to DfE Sign In, please start from the required link and enter your email address and DfE password:
<%=servicesUrl%>

If these steps haven’t helped you gain access to the service you need to please wait for us to respond to your query.

Thank you

DfE Sign-in
